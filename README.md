## Lazy Load
**Lazy loading** is one of the most common design patterns used in web and mobile development. It is widely used with frameworks like **Angular** and **React** to increase an applicationâ€™s performance by reducing initial loading time.
In the earlier versions of React, lazy loading was implemented using third-party libraries. However, React introduced two new native features to implement lazy loading with the React v16.6 update.

## Advantages of Lazy Loading
 - Reduces initial loading time by reducing the bundle size.
 - Reduces browser workload.
 - Improves application performance in low bandwidth situations.
 - Improves user experience at initial loading.

## Disadvantages of Lazy Loading
- Not suitable for small-scale applications.

- Requires additional communication with the server to fetch resources.
- Can affect SEO and ranking.
